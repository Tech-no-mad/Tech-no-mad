- 👋 Hi, I’m @Tech-no-mad, also known as Karteek Tadimalla.
- 👀 I’m passionate about tech, testing, and building real-time projects with a positive impact.
- 🌱 I’ve completed learning Vue.js and am now advancing my skills in Flask, DSA, and intermediate Deep Learning.
- 💼 My recent projects include:

    - Library Management System: A Flask app with JWT-based security, email notifications, and admin features, managed with Redis and Celery.
    - Grocery Web App: A shopping app with search functionality, CRUD operations, and MVC architecture.
    - ML Projects: A Kaggle project on crime forecasting and an AI vs. human text classifier.

- 💞️ I’m open to collaborating on ML problems, Kaggle challenges, and full-stack projects.
